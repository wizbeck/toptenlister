# README

Thanks for checking out my first rails app TopTenLister
The purpose of the app is to ultimately provide reccomendations to users to check out or research things other people might reccommend by adding it to a top ten list for the user base to see. 

The app is pretty basic, however I will be trying to update it with new CSS styling to make it look a little better.

Deployment Instructions:

Note: I had to run this using Node version 14.11.0 due some issues with webpacker and javascript(to my understanding). So watch out for that.

 IMPORTANT:
Before launching, make sure to bundle install and migrate database. 

I have no seed file set up, but you should be able to start creating a user or log into the website via google if you choose, and then you can test the website out using the navbar at the top or the links on the pages when you get to them.
