nested routes

we want users to have a nested lists route and to be able to make a new list from a nested route?
USERS
users/:user_id/lists/new - new_user_list_path - create a new list through user lists index page?
users/:user_id/lists/:id - user_list_path - nested show
maybe users/:user_id/lists - user_lists_path


TOPICS
