nested routes

we want users to have a nested lists route and to be able to make a new list from a nested route?
USERS
users/:user_id/lists/new - new_user_list_path - create a new list through user lists index page?
users/:user_id/lists/:id - user_list_path - nested show
maybe users/:user_id/lists - user_lists_path


TOPICS
topics can have a nested index route
topics/:id/lists - lists with that specific topic

topics/:id/users - users who have lists with this specific topic

Thursday 
finish out nested routes
validations
add fieldwitherrors
scope
CRUD functionality with models that need it 
refactor

create a search feature where a user can enter the any combination of characters and it will render lists on index page with like characters.

NOTES FOR UPDATING PROJECT:
- Figure out the collection_select on the new list form. For some reason adding a class tag to the form helper does not render the select field with the form-select class to use bootstrap styling.
- figure out the list style rendering for individual lists and topics. hide the bullet point text-decoration, use some sort of flex and maybe create cards out of each list. maybe a two column form.
- remove the text value of the search field on the list index page, and create a placeholder instead so that when a use tries to click the search button it will be empty when the click instead of leaving placeholder text in the field
- center everything on list index view and topics index view.
- and user's lists view ^^
